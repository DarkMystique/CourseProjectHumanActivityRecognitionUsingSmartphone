Not going to produce codebook as of now for the following reasons:

1. We are not taught on how to produce codebook! NOT in this course, NOR in the prior courses which I had completed. Thus I feel the requirement of producing codebook in order to pass is beyond my ability.

2. As I have not attended any course about RMarkdown (or other similar course), I am not going to waste my time to read all over any other places (which may take weeks to understand for someone who have no programming background like me)!

Thank you.
